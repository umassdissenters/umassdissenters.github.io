            Pledge of Support
          </h2>

          <p>
            In light of University of Massachusetts Amherst’s repressive actions against protestors in the last academic year, I stand with students and community members who were protesting against UMass ties to the genocide in Gaza.
            <br>
            I condemn the university’s harsh crackdown on peaceful protestors, which includes: calling the state police, placing unfair code of conduct charges on students, revoking students’ degrees, banning community members from campus, and attempting to push felony charges onto student leaders. I also call on UMass to publicize its ties to war profiteers such as Raytheon.
            <br>
            I pledge to use my power to support the rights of the UMass community to engage in peaceful demonstrations and will stand with students and community members against current and further repression by the university.
